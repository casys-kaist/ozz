    rds: add missing barrier to release_refill
    
    The functions clear_bit and set_bit do not imply a memory barrier, thus it
    may be possible that the waitqueue_active function (which does not take
    any locks) is moved before clear_bit and it could miss a wakeup event.
    
    Fix this bug by adding a memory barrier after clear_bit.
