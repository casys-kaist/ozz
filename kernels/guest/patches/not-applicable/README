- c57a91fb1ccfa203ba3e31e5a389cb04de5b0561: (in commit 592fa002180a)
  there is a smp_store_release() in io_commit_cqring() between
  __io_cqring_fill_event() (storing a value to cached_cq_tail) and
  io_cqring_ev_posted_iopoll() (calling waitqueue_active()). Thus, the
  store buffer emulation cannot trigger the bug. This can be triggered
  if we develop a mechanism to prefetch loads.

  This happened in reality, but we cannot trigger the bug since it
  happened in the async thread. By the design of Syzkaller, it is hard
  to track the execution path of async threads.
