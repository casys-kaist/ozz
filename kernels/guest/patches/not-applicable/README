- c57a91fb1ccfa203ba3e31e5a389cb04de5b0561: (in commit 592fa002180a)
  there is a smp_store_release() in io_commit_cqring() between
  __io_cqring_fill_event() (storing a value to cached_cq_tail) and
  io_cqring_ev_posted_iopoll() (calling waitqueue_active()). Thus, the
  store buffer emulation cannot trigger the bug. This can be triggered
  if we develop a mechanism to prefetch loads.
